## Test Cases Explanation 🧪🔍🚀

### `test_load_openai_key` 🗝️🔑
This test checks the `load_openai_key` function to ensure it correctly retrieves the OpenAI API key from the environment variable. It uses the `patch` decorator from the `unittest.mock` module to mock the `os.getenv` function and simulate the environment variable value. The test asserts that the returned API key matches the expected value.

### `test_configure_streamlit` 🖥️🎨
The purpose of this test is to verify that the `configure_streamlit` function 🎛️ correctly sets the Streamlit page configuration. It uses the `patch` decorator to mock the `streamlit.set_page_config` function and checks if it is called with the expected arguments.

### `test_upload_csv_file` 📂⬆️
This test verifies the behavior of the `upload_csv_file` function, which prompts the user to upload a CSV file using Streamlit's `file_uploader` function. The test mocks the `file_uploader` function to simulate the file upload and asserts that the returned value matches the expected value.

### `test_process_csv_file` 📊✨
The purpose of this test is to validate the `process_csv_file` function, which processes the uploaded CSV file and returns a Pandas DataFrame. It creates a mock CSV file using the `StringIO` class and checks if the returned DataFrame has the expected shape.

### `test_run_agent_with_csv_file` (Skipped Test) 🕵️📊🔮
This test case is skipped because it requires an external dependency, which is not available in the testing environment. It tests the `run_agent` function by passing a DataFrame and simulating a user question. It uses `patch` to mock Streamlit's `text_input`, `spinner`, and `write` functions. The assertion checks if the result of the agent's execution is correctly displayed.

### `test_run_agent_without_csv_file` 💼🚫📊
This test ensures that the `run_agent` function handles the scenario when no CSV file is uploaded. It uses `patch` to mock the `streamlit.write` function and checks if the expected message is displayed.

Note: The skipped test case is marked as such because it requires specific external dependencies or conditions that are not met in the testing environment. It can be enabled and executed in an appropriate setup to validate its functionality.
